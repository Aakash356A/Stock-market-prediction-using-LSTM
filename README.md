What is LSTM?
LSTM is an advanced version of RNN, the RNNs have loops allowing them to use past information to predict the future but RNNs can retrieve only recent information and they also suffer from vanishing gradient problems. The LSTMs as the name suggests can remember information over a long period also, they work well with time series data
